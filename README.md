Passive Indoor Location Sensing using WiFi

This project is aimed at developing an innovative approach to passive indoor location sensing using WiFi technology. The main objective of the project is to obtain granular level view of customers behavior in the context of the retail industry.

Before running the program, you must have the following installed on your machine:

    Python 3
    Required packages (see requirements.txt)

The system is designed for ease of use with a single command to execute and no need to navigate through nested directories. To run the program from the root directory named "Position Predictor", users can simply follow two steps:

 - pip3 install -r requirements.txt (To install required dependencies)
 - python main.py (To run the code)

Within seconds to minutes, the system will output scores of the Baseline Random Forest Regressor, K-means algorithm, and Random Forest Classifier. Furthermore, it will display a plot of predicted positions by the Random Forest Regressor and custom model against target positions.
